Fallout Variant 1

Notes:
 - This version is simpler than Variant 2, here we leak a hardcoded password
 
 - You can try any password you like by changing the originalPassword variable in the source code
 
 - This code gives better results that Variant 2 because there is way less noise in the side channel attack
 
 - Complied with -o0 flag to prevent optimizations
 
 - A password length up to 1024 is allowed
 
 - Fallout Variant2 have more explanations in it's Readme file and the comments in the code 
 so you can refer to there if something here isn't explained
 
 
 Steps to run:
 	- open terminal and type "make"
 	- type in terminal "./attack"
 	- results are displayed on the screen like in Fallout Variant 2
