Fallout Variant 2

Notes: 
- This code does 2 levels of sampling so the final results aren't that great

- The code itself when you run it once, performs the attacks 1000 time

- You can change the number of how many times the attack is repeated by changing probes variable in the code

- You can run the file numerous times by entering this command into the terminal
	"for i in {1..5}; do ./attack; done" 
	where 5 is the number of tries you can change it to whatever you want

- The code won't run if there is no file called password, so dont delete it!!!!

- The source file is compiled with flag -o0 so no optimizations are made to it

- A maximum length of the password entered in the file is 1024

Steps To Run:
	1- Write a password that you want to leak in the file "password"
	2- open terminal and write "make"
	3- write into terminal "./attack"
	4- the results will be displayed in the terminal with the original password
